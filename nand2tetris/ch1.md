Hello, and welcome to Nand to Tetris. My name is Shimon Schocken, and I'm a Professor of Computer Science at IDC Herzliya and Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 

你好，欢迎来到与非门和俄罗斯方块。我的名字是西蒙·肖肯，我是

Hi, I'm Noam Nisan, a Professor of Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a researcher at Microsoft. Together we'll teach you this course. 

And and the first thing that we're going to want to do in this unit is to give you the overall picture of what this course is all about. Well, in this course we're going to build a complete. 

General purpose working computer from the ground up. Hardware and software. And, we're going to divide this huge enterprise into two separate courses. 

In the first course, which is going to be seven weeks long, this course we're going to build the hardware of the computer.

 And in the second course that will be offered, later, we're going to do complete the picture and build the software hierarchy that sits on top of the computer that you will build in the first course. So that's what we're going to do in the next seven weeks. We're going to focus on building the hardware of the computer, which we call. Heck. So it's going to be a great journey consisting of seven weeks, six projects, one computer and zero prerequisite knowledge. We assume no knowledge whatsoever in computer science or engineering. Everything will be given to you in the course itself. So this has been our first unit in Nand to Tetris and coming up is the road ahead in more detailed description what we're going to do in this course.
